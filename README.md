# Bare-bones Vanilla JS starter with Docker Build

Clearly a work in progress ...

Bare-bones project starter with CSS normalize, Parcel, some JS DOM utils and that's about it! Development and build envs are in Docker to avoid cluttering up your hard drive. 

* Install Docker for your platform
* Run development with `./dev.sh`
* Build for prod with `./build.sh`

Files
* `src/index.html`
* `src/css/index.scss`
* `src/js/index.js`
